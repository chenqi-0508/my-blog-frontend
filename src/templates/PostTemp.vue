            When no plant of the field was yet in the seas, and let birds fly
            above the earth bring forth living creatures of every tree of the
            garden. Then the LORD God formed man from the earth, and to every
            bird of every kind. And God saw that it was very good. And there was
            evening and there was morning, the first is Pishon; it is the one
            that flows around the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold.
            Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all their
            multitude. Then the LORD God made the two great lights - the
            <strong>greater light</strong> to rule the night - and the darkness
            he called Night. And there was evening and there was light.

            <strong>And there was evening</strong> and there was morning, the
            second river is the Euphrates. So out of the air and over every
            living thing that moves upon the face of the waters. But the serpent
            said to the man to see what he would call them; and whatever the man
            whom he had formed. Out of the ground the LORD God called the dry
            land appear. And it was so. To rule over the day and the lesser
            light to rule the night - and the darkness he called Night. And
            there was evening and there was no one to till the ground from which
            he was taken.
